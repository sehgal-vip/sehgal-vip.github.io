In my current day avatar, I lead Product and Tech teams working on EV adoption in India. The problem compounds: financing vehicles for buyers with thin credit histories, leasing electric buses to operators navigating new unit economics, building risk infrastructure for a market still taking shape. I build lending systems, operational workflows, credit models—the invisible scaffolding that makes the transition possible.

I was that kid who lived for quizzing in school and college. The one who'd go down rabbit holes about obscure facts just because they connected to something else interesting. That same energy shows up now in how I learn: voraciously, promiscuously across domains. The Curiocity Loop is just the visible artifact of that process. It is a newsletter where I take complex ideas and make them accessible, usually through analogies that surprise us both.

All that learning points toward something specific: finding the elegant explanation that makes familiar things click differently. Uncovering first principles buried under jargon. Watching separate ideas suddenly form constellations. I have an MBA, so I can speak fluent spreadsheet when needed, but the questions that pull me harder live in uncharted territory: Why do systems break the way they do? What happens where technical precision collides with human messiness? How do you build for uncertainty? What can strategy board games teach us about decisions that spreadsheets miss?

I'm a perennial learner who doesn't believe in staying in lanes. Philosophy sharpens product strategy. First principles thinking debugs both code and arguments. Every new domain is another crater to peer into—you don't know what glows until you make the trek. The best insights come from being comfortable with not knowing, then building the scaffolding to find out. Cross-pollination isn't just nice to have; it's where the breakthroughs hide.

Best thinking happens in the margins between disciplines. Compartmentalized chaos. The mess is where the meaning lives—you just need the right containers. And the willingness to reorganize when they stop serving you.

Right now I'm building lending systems, writing about AI and philosophy, maintaining a blog with Jekyll because sometimes you need to understand how things work before making them beautiful. Still mapping territories without names. Still asking what else glows in the dark.

You'll find me asking one more clarifying question. Making the obscure oddly clear for the genuinely curious. Somewhere between systematic and spontaneous. Probably learning something I have no business knowing. Will find a use for it eventually.

Always happy to talk about systems, ideas, or whatever's got you curious. Coffee's on me.
